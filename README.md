- Presentation (Google Slides)
  - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VOKThQU5-b4-bnefdcjQFqS2OTrTk7YJTZ_tH2pm3Ic/edit?usp=sharing
- Reason why we selected our topic
  - We are interested in exploring if there is a correlation between physical health indicators and mental health outcomes for patients.
  - We are all interested in or have backgrounds in the health industry.
- Description of our source of data
  - Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system
  - Our dataset consists of health survey data from 400,000 people from the years 2011-2015.
  - There are 330 total columns, but a small percentage of columns are mostly empty.
- Questions we hope to answer with the data
  - Which health choices are most correlated with mental health?
  - Which common diseases are most correlated with impact mental health?
  - Can we predict mental health outcomes from physical health backgrounds?
- Description of the communication protocols
  - We use a slack group chat to collaborate on our project goals, creating threads under messages with suggestions, questions, next steps, etc.
  - We use Zoom video conferencing to discuss impediments to our project progress and reach solutions as a team.
